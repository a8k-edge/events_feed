This is designed to create inner reflection and deeper self understanding.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* We'll welcome each other\n* I'll explain what mindset tool we'll be working with\n* We'll go through it step by step\n* We'll share our reflections at the end\n\nBefore the meet, you may have thoughts of... \"Do I really want to do this?\" / \"What if it's weird?\" / \"What if I feel awkward?\" It's normal to have these thoughts. We experience this any time we go out of our comfort zone.\n\nI look forward to meeting with you,\n\nShay\n\nP.S - Please join 2 minutes or so ahead of the start time, so that we're ready to go.",

I will share all participants contact details on a pdf. You are then free to arrange in your own time to contact those with whom you resonate.\n\nThats it. No cold sausage rolls, no early mornings, no rubbish coffee, and no more awkwardly sliding out of a conversation with an insurance salesman and an I.T consultant.\n\nI﻿f you do not have a service or product to offer, please use your time to share your inspirations, recommendations or ideas.\n\nP﻿lease DO promote your own groups if you are a facilitator yourself.\nP﻿lease do actively listen to each participants pitch.\nAfterwards, p﻿lease do actively support others by suggesting/recommending them to your extended networks, friends, family, colleagues who may be interested.\n\n**P﻿reparation prior to the meeting**\n\nPlease prepare a verbal pitch that fits inside of 3 minutes that describes what you do, what you are offering and what you are looking for. Remember to state if you are location based or online.\n\nPlease prepare a piece of text to share with other participants that looks like this: **Your name. Your business name or role. Your website. Your preferred contact number/email. Short description of your business/offerings, max three lines.** I will collect and compile into a pdf to distribute to all.\n\nP﻿lease share this event with your friends, acquaintances, and social media. There's nothing quite like it out there, and the more onboard the better chance we all have of success!\n\nIm looking forward to seeing all of your smiley successful faces :)",

              "description": "Hey Everyone,\n\nThis is an awesome group for English classes. My name is Danish from London [🇬🇧](https://emojipedia.org/flag-united-kingdom),\n\nThe event will be @ 8:00PM UK 🇬🇧 time,\n\nIf you are interested in speaking English in an easy way where you can have day-to-day conversations with anyone from native speakers to local speakers this is the right place for you. The event Is for 18-30 Years old.\n\nI will teach you how to have a basic conversation with an individual and also be able to understand and speak English in a non-academic way where it isn't boring.\n\n**Important**: Do not join, if you want to learn English as an academic or for qualification purposes, this is just for students or learners who want to be able to speak English naturally for conversation purposes.\n\nThe Zoom Class will be Free with other members. I also provide 1 to 1 free English class over the Zoom. The reason why I want to help is because I understand how tough it can be to learn English when you don't have a native speaker who can teach you the right way.\n\nThe Event length will be 30-60 mins, so if you can spare 30 minutes to join the class then you can.\n\nfor any questions, you can message me on WhatsApp +447930849679",

Before that, you will be on a waitlist to enter.\n* Please ensure you're muted at all times to minimise disturbance.\n* If you would like to ask a question during the talk, use the Chat.\n\n🗣️**ABOUT THE SPEAKERS**\n\n**Adam Hall**\n*Principal technologist, AND Digital*\nAdam Hall has worked as a Tech Leader and an Agile Coach since the turn of the millennium. He's passionate about solving human problems with technology and knows that teams working closely together is the way to improve the products we create. Adam is worried about the future and will do anything in his power to ensure that AI adoption is done responsibly and intentionally for the betterment of humanity. If he doesn't, the short slide to robotic domination will be the future that is inherited by his 3 boys. His dog is indifferent to the incoming android apocalypse.\n\n**Jas Singh**\n*Director of Agile Coaching, Five AI*\nJas made the switch from disillusioned waterfall battler to agile over 15 years ago and has not looked back. Having built coaching teams with a focus on the system, he now adds his professional coaching skills to support growth in this ever increasingly complex world. The theme of AI is front and centre, as he aids much smarter folk than him in tackling the Autonomous driving problem head on, hoping to be more part of the steering function than a passenger.\n\n**Ricardo Liberato**\n*Chief Principal Consultant, Solid Reason*\nRicardo brings a wealth of experience in scaling agile efficiently across various teams and groups, capitalising on lean principles and Gail’s law as the foundation of his work. He is the co-host of the enterprise agility podcast, where he brings his scepticism for the agile industrial complex into the hot topics on enterprise agility. Ricardo is passionate about exploring the intersection between AI technology and agile methodologies to create sustainable, high performing agile teams and agile enterprises. In his spare time he is a software developer building DevOps observability systems for large corporations, pioneering applying natural language processing and large language models to self service observability.\n\nFacilitated by **Jessica Allen**\n*Agile Coach, AND Digital*\n\nSave the date! 📆",

We will try to answer them with our collective brain.\nThe second is a continuation of our original meetups - how to make a business out of Elementor.\n\nAs usual we will try to answer any questions as collaboratively as possible so that we can hear as many solutions as possible, and hopefully see them in action.\n\nIf you want a specific question answered then head over to our Whatsapp page where people are already dropping in their questions, or you can drop a question in here.\n\nWhatsapp Group - https://chat.whatsapp.com/CRSgFCl8Pxx1fANQbWbOMO",

What is really meant is a SHARED sense of humour.\n\nThe same applies to good communication.\n\nFor you, good communication may mean being able to share everything; for your partner, it may mean something entirely different.\n\nJoin us and find out more.\n\nIF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM GETTING IN, CALL JO ON 07956 568847",

              "description": "“I want to be a coach but…”\n“I want to learn how to do NLP but…”\n“I’d love to learn about myself and what makes me tick, but …”\nSound familiar? I hear this all the time, and the reasons are usually totally valid, such as:\n“I have family commitments”\n“I can’t take the time off work to do the course”\n“It’s too much information in a short space of time”\nThere are many more. I totally understand. In order for me to do all of my courses, I had to take annual leave (unpaid in some instances), travel long distances, pay for the course, bed and board, buy food, pay travel and concentrate for long, intense days. This is a huge commitment.\nHow would it be for you if you could bypass some of these obstacles? If you could undertake an internationally recognised NLP course in the comfort of your own home, and in small, achievable chunks?\nNLP is the lead tool in the coaching world. Coaching is an ever-growing profession, and in an era where people are asking more of themselves and often not knowing how to clear the obstacles, we need ways of navigating this territory.\nThe NLP Diploma is a gateway to the world of human psychology. It offers an introduction to a range of tools and strategies that can move you from a stuck to a more resourceful place.\nIts applications are endless! If you want to:\n· Set up a coaching business.\n· Add tools to your current profession.\n· Learn how to manage your own emotions, behaviours and drives.\n· Help others to overcome barriers to success.\n· Grow and nurture that zest for life.\nThen this is for you!\nIn small, bitesize chunks, I will walk you through the NLP Diploma programme, leading to an internationally recognised qualification from the world’s leading NLP organisation (INLPTA)\nFor just two and a half hours a week, for 12 weeks, you will learn a wealth of invaluable tools such as:\n· How we understand the world\n· How we process information\n· How you change unwanted behaviour\n· How to plan and undertake a coaching session\n· How to understand peoples’ outcomes and work towards them\n· How to develop linguistic mastery\n· How to develop and maintain trust and rapport\nAnd much more!\nThe first three sessions are FREE, so you can make your mind up about whether it is for you. If it is, then you will continue on a weekly basis for nine more sessions.\nOn completion of the course, you will obtain your qualification, and will also have accomplished the first four days of the practitioner programme, should you wish to continue on your NLP journey.",

Her photographs documented the catastrophe of economic collapse while also emphasising empathy and community. Her art shone a light on the injustices of racism, poverty and inequality of the time.

              "description": "**Topic:**\nAn Agile Coaches Guide to Showing Your Value with Bob Galen\n\n**Synopsis:**\nSome of the biggest questions facing agile coaches today, whether external consultants/contractors or internal employees; Coaches, ScrumMasters, or leaders are:\n\n* What do you actually do as a coach?\n* What difference are you making? What is your value?\n* How do I measure your impact?\n* Why do I need you as my coach?\n* Do I really need your role in my organization?\n\n**Challenging questions to answer, right?**\n\nThe premise of this talk is that most coaches are fundamentally unprepared to answer them. That is,many of us struggle to communicate our value, while not appearing self-centered or braggadocios.\n\nIn this workshop we will explore how to effectively navigate these value-based questions. We’ll begin in the client entry process and discuss keys for setting up win-win coaching agreements and managing expectations. Next, we’ll explore a wide-variety of approaches for measure agile coaches, their value and their impact. While there is no singular metric, you’ll be exposed to many successful approaches.\nAnd finally, we’ll talk about the importance of brand building and not be shy or reticent in talking about you, which is a problem for so many coaches.\n\nWe’ll wrap things up with a Dojo session where we practice strategies for common, value-based situations, so you can leave with new ideas and skills and increased confidence.\n\n**Speaker:**\n**Bob Galen** is an Agile Practitioner, Trainer & Coach based in Cary, NC. In this role he helps guide companies and teams in their pragmatic adoption and organizational shift towards agile methods of working. Bob has been doing that since the late 1990s, so he’s deeply experienced.\n\nHe is the Director of Agile Practice at Zenergy Technologies, a leading business agility transformation company. Bob is also President and Head Coach at RGCG a boutique agile coaching firm.\n\nBob regularly speaks at international conferences and professional groups on topics related to agile software development, testing, scaling, and organizational leadership. He is a Certified Enterprise Coach (CEC), Scrum Alliance CAL trainer, and an active member of the Agile & Scrum Alliances.\n\nHe’s published four agile-centric books:\n\n* The Three Pillars of Agile Quality and Testing in 2015\n* Scrum Product Ownership, 3’rd Edition in 2019\n* Agile Reflections in 2012\n* Extraordinarily Badass Agile Coaching in 2022.\n\n**Sponsor:**\n**Agile Mastery Institute:** Because Mastery Matters.\n\n*AMI is breaking the paradigm of agile certification to offer agile professionals a real pathway towards mastery of their role built around the combination of classroom, coaching and community.*\nFind out more: [https://agilemasteryinstitute.com/](https://agilemasteryinstitute.com/)",

              "description": "**Scrum Event & Andrew Hunt (Agile Manifesto Author) present: Ending the Age of Misery**\n\n**ABSTRACT:**\nThe number one problem with software development is thinking that there’s a number one problem.\n\nIn fact, there are so many unaddressed problems in software development organizations that instead of the Information Age, you might call this the *Age of Misery.*\n\nCompanies large and small fall prey to the joyless enshitification of their business models and users. Developers tire of endless ticketing systems, ponderous practices, and disconnected leadership.\n\nWouldn’t it be nice to actually get down to work and take comfort in reliable, consistent deliveries that delight the user community?\n\nThere’s no single answer, no single solution. But there is a small set of areas that you *can* address to end the *Age of Misery!*\n\n**ABOUT Andy Hunt:**\nAndy Hunt is a programmer turned consultant, author and publisher. He’s authored a dozen books, including the best-selling *“The Pragmatic Programmer,”* was one of the 17 authors of the Agile Manifesto and founders of the Agile Alliance, and co-founded the Pragmatic Bookshelf, publishing award-winning and critically acclaimed books for software developers.\n\nHe currently writes science fiction [(see conglommora.com)](https://conglommora.com/) and is experimenting with [The GROWS Method®.](https://growsmethod.com/)\n\n**AGENDA:**\n18:45 - 19:00 - Event Welcome & Networking\n19:00 - 20:00 - Talk\n20:00 - 20:15 - Event Questions & Networking\n20.15 - Event Ends\n\nSEU:\nAs a *\"Scrum Alliance* *User Group\"*, you will earn 1.5 SEUs from this event.",
